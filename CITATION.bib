    abstract = {We explain how to forge public parameters for the Digital Signature Standard with
        two known messages which always produce the same set of valid signatures (what we
        call a collision). This attack is thwarted by using the generation algorithm suggested
        in the specifications of the Standard, so it proves one always need to check proper
        generation. We also present a similar attack when using this generation algorithm
        within a complexity 274, which is better than the birthday attack which seeks for
        collisions on the underlying hash function.},
